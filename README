- Briefly justify the structure of your program; why you defined the functions you did, etc.
My program creates empty vectors and maps in the main hw5.cpp function, then utilizes functions within language_model.cpp to pass them by reference and update their contents in main. The main function loads and stores the words of the .txt files within main, then all of the other operations are handled within the switch statement. Each switch statement contains a function that will execute and reorder the map that contains all the trigrams in the specified order depending on the command that was selected.


- If applicable: Tell the graders if you could not do everything. Where did you stop? What did you get stuck on? What are the parts you know do not work according to the requirements?
For some reason I could not figure out, the <END_1> and <END_2> would not be saved into my map of trigrams. This results in the output of the a and c commands to skip over any lines that contains <END_1> or <END_2>, then print the rest in the correct order. My c command was working properly at one point, and printing the correct output compared to the sample run, but then it stopped working and would not go back to normal even when I restored old code. Besides that, everything works as expected.
